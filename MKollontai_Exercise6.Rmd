## Exercise 31 on page 154 of Introduction to Probability

Using the Life Table for 1981 given in Appendix C, find the probability that a male of age 60 in 1981 lives to age 80. Find the same probability for a female. 

```{r}
M_at_80 <- 36848
M_at_60 <- 81485
F_at_80 <- 57062
F_at_60 <- 89835

P_male <- M_at_80/M_at_60
P_female <- F_at_80/F_at_60
```

#### Given that a male made it to 60 years old in 1981, the probability of him making it to age 80 was **`r round(P_male,3)`**.

#### The same probability for a female in the same time period was **`r round(P_female,3)`**.
