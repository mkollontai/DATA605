## Exercise 26 on page 39 of Introduction to Probability

Two cards are drawn successively from a deck of 52 cards. Find the probability
that the second card is higher in rank than the first card. Hint: Show that 1 =
$P(higher) + P(lower) + P(same)$ and use the fact that $P(higher) = P(lower)$

Clearly, there are 3 possibilities when drawing two cards: either the second card is lower than the first, higher than the first, or equal to it (in rank). Therefore, $P(higher) + P(lower) + P(same)$.

#### Assuming that $P(higher) = P(lower)$ as stated in the problem, let us set the probabilities of those two values as $x$. Therefore

$$1 = 2x + P(same)$$

$P(same)$ is equal to the probability of the same card being drawn, so $\frac{1}{52}$.

$$1 = 2x + \frac{1}{52}$$
$$2x = 1 - \frac{1}{52}$$
$$2x = \frac{51}{52}$$
$$x = \frac{51}{104}$$

$$x = 49.0346%$$
